                    <h1>Biography</h1>
                    <p>
                        Philip Heyman gave his concerto debut aged eleven, and went on to study at the Royal College
                        of Music, winning three major viola prizes.
                        <br><br>
                        On graduation he was immediately offered a permanent post with the BBC Symphony
                        Orchestra, with whom he toured extensively and appeared in many Prom concerts.
                        Subsequently he accepted the position of Sub-Principal Viola with English National Opera
                        where he remained for nine years. During this time he worked with many major British
                        orchestras and ensembles, as well as giving recitals and teaching.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1998 he took up his position as Principal Viola for Welsh National Opera, where he remained
                        until 2021,and has consequently performed many of the major orchestral solos, some on radio
                        and television. He has been invited as guest Principal with many national orchestras and groups
                        including CBSO, RPO, BSO, RLPO and BBCPO.
                        <br><br>
                        As a part of a viola/piano duo, he continues to give solo recitals and offers consultations and
                        teaches, both privately and at Cardiff University. He is a member of the Cardiff based viola
                        quartet <a href="https://absolutezeroviola4.com/" target="_blank">Absolute Zero</a> and has also started to explore the repertoire for guitar, flute & viola as a
                        member of Still Life with Guitar.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2002, Philip became the owner of Europe's first Pellegrina pomposa model viola; an
                        instrument he considers to be a significant innovation in string design and which he feels
                        privileged to champion.
